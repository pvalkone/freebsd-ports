Bringing emails to the terminal is a pain. First, because they are
sensitive data. Secondly, the existing TUIs (Mutt, NeoMutt, Alpine,
aerc...) are really hard to configure. They require time and patience.

The aim of Himalaya is to extract the email logic into a simple (yet
solid) CLI API that can be used directly from the terminal, from
scripts, from UIs... Possibilities are endless!
