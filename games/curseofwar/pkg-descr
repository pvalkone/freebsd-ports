This is a fast-paced action strategy game implemented using the ncurses
user interface.

Unlike most RTS, you are not controlling units, but focus on high-level
strategic planning: Building infrastructure, securing resources,
and moving your armies.

The core game mechanics turns out to be quite close to WWI-WWII type of
warfare, however, there is no explicit reference to any historical period.
